# Project: Star Wars Survey Data Visualization

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the team at FiveThirtyEight was interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. One question that particularly interested the team was: Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data before they could get started answering this question. They used SurveyMonkey, an online survey tool, to survey Star Wars fans. They received 835 responses total, which can be found in the "star_wars.csv" file.

In this project we will be creating visualizations of the data.
